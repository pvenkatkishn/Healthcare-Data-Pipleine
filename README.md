# Healthcare-Data-Pipleine

This is a Health and Genomics Data Pipeline that gives out personalized healthcare recommendations based on data sourced from the interent. I primarily used AWS Services like S3, Glue, Redshift Serverless, Cloudwatch, IAM and billing & Cost Management. I worked on this project to primarily build my portfolio as an Analyst. 

I used Python to load and clean the data initially on Google Colab and then moved on to using AWS S3 for storing my data securely.
